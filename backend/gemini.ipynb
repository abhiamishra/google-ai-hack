The student is looking to apply to a university program in United States. They are not planning to attend any other academic programs in the United States. They will not be enrolled as a full-time student. Their level of English proficiency is Beginner. They have not taken any TOEFL/IELTS exam. They do not have any English courses they've signed up for attaining English proficiency. They have not participated in any other activities that demonstrate your English proficiency (e.g., English-taught academic programs, work experience in an English-speaking environment).\\n\\n\\n\\nUse the F-1 VIsa requirements given below:\\n\\\"\\nHome > Working in the United States > Students and Exchange Visitors > Students and Employment\\nStudents and Employment\\nALERT: Please remember that photos submitted to USCIS must be unmounted and unretouched. Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced. The submission of any mounted or retouched images will delay the processing of your application and may prompt USCIS to require that you appear at an Applicant Support Center to verify your identity.\\nIf you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa.\\nThere are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.\\nYou may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:\\nYou must be enrolled in an \\\"academic\\\" educational program, a language-training program, or a vocational program\\nYour school must be approved by the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement\\nYou must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution\\nYou must be proficient in English or be enrolled in courses leading to English proficiency\\nYou must have sufficient funds available for self-support during the entire proposed course of study\\nYou must maintain a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up.\\nF-1 Student Visa\\nThe F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.\\nM-1 Student Visa\\nThe M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.\\nMENU\\nPage 2\\nEmployment\\nF-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:\\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT)\\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) (pre-completion or post-completion)\\nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training Extension (OPT)\\nF-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.\\nFor both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.\\nFor more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.\\nIn general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  Find additional information about  International Students and Social Security Numbers (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.\\nSpecial Instructions\\nIf you are interested in changing to F or M Student Status, see the Changing to a Nonimmigrant F or M Student Status page.\\nLast Reviewed/Updated: 03/27/2024\\\"\\n\\nCheck the student's information with above information and detail a checklist about what the student still needs to do to get the F1 Visa. Make these items into a to-do list. If there is a violation between the information and rules, make that the first checklist item.

    "  '''The student will be going to UT Austin in the August of 2024 pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. The student is looking to apply to a university program in United States. They are not planning to attend any other academic programs in the United States. They will not be enrolled as a full-time student. Their level of English proficiency is Beginner. They have not taken any TOEFL/IELTS exam. They do not have any English courses they've signed up for attaining English proficiency. They have not participated in any other activities that demonstrate your English proficiency (e.g., English-taught academic programs, work experience in an English-speaking environment).\\n\\n\\n\\nUse the F-1 VIsa requirements given below:\\n\\\"\\nHome > Working in the United States > Students and Exchange Visitors > Students and Employment\\nStudents and Employment\\nALERT: Please remember that photos submitted to USCIS must be unmounted and unretouched. Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced. The submission of any mounted or retouched images will delay the processing of your application and may prompt USCIS to require that you appear at an Applicant Support Center to verify your identity.\\nIf you would like to study as a full-time student in the United States, you will generally need a student visa.\\nThere are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons wishing to study in the United States. These visas are commonly known as the F and M visas.\\nYou may enter in the F-1 or M-1 visa category provided you meet the following criteria:\\nYou must be enrolled in an \\\"academic\\\" educational program, a language-training program, or a vocational program\\nYour school must be approved by the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement\\nYou must be enrolled as a full-time student at the institution\\nYou must be proficient in English or be enrolled in courses leading to English proficiency\\nYou must have sufficient funds available for self-support during the entire proposed course of study\\nYou must maintain a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up.\\nF-1 Student Visa\\nThe F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept international students.\\nM-1 Student Visa\\nThe M-1 visa (Vocational Student) category includes students in vocational or other nonacademic programs, other than language training.\\nMENU\\nPage 2\\nEmployment\\nF-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year, but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment:\\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT)\\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) (pre-completion or post-completion)\\nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training Extension (OPT)\\nF-1 students may also be eligible to work off-campus on a case-by-case basis as a result of special situations such as severe economic hardship or special student relief. M-1 students may engage in practical training only after they have completed their studies.\\nFor both F-1 and M-1 students any off-campus training employment must be related to their area of study and must be authorized prior to starting any work by the Designated School Official (the person authorized to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)) and USCIS.\\nFor more information on the Student and Exchange Visitors Program, see the Student & Exchange Visitor Program, Immigration & Customs Enforcement and the Study in the States Training Opportunities in the United States pages.\\nIn general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.

      " with one's virtues, values, and purpose. This view emphasizes the importance of living a life of excellence, meaningfulness, and fulfillment.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Purpose-driven life:** Many people find meaning in life through their work, relationships, or other activities that give them a sense of purpose and accomplishment. This could involve pursuing a career that is meaningful to them, contributing to society through charitable work, or caring for loved ones.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **No inherent meaning:** Some existentialists argue that life has no inherent meaning and that it is up to individuals to create their own meaning through their choices and actions. This perspective emphasizes personal responsibility and authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Perspectives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Scientific:** Some scientists approach the meaning of life from a biological or evolutionary perspective, suggesting that it is related to survival, reproduction, and the continuation of the species.\n",

      " and it can evolve and change over time. By reflecting on our values, beliefs, experiences, and aspirations, we can strive to create a life that is meaningful and fulfilling to us.\n",
